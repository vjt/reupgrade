ReUpgrade + Git-enabled flashrd
===============================

I use this set of scripts, based on git and flashrd, to manage
both configuration and upgrades of ours (vjt ++ nhaima) lovely
embedded OpenBSD gateway, running onto a Soekris net4801.

Documentation is yet to be written, but the general picture is
to prepare an image using a modified flashrd that handles .git
repositories and keep into them the whole configuration.. into
separate branches.

You should have an "upstream/4.X" version, upon which you base
your configuration, say, "brahma/4.X". When an upgrade occurs,
you simply revert your configuration to the upstream one via a
git checkout, untar the distribution packages and commit every
change. Then you checkout back your configuration into a shiny
new branch and rebase it onto the new upstream configuration.

This whole stuff is handled by rebase.sh.. while all the other
scripts serve syncing and finalization.

I plan on writing a comprehensive tutorial once this system is
solid and battle-tested: for now you have all the code :-) and
the commit message 096ed3a193bfc615bbd103d0db278e681aaca3f8 to
get started. Please note that I plan to do "hot" upgrades thus
without requiring to copy the embedded machine directory trees
back and forth to another OpenBSD machine.

Have fun, and stay tuned! :-)
