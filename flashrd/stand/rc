# bootstrap flashrd for running real images
#
# flashrd quirks:
#
# - real /etc/rc has umount -a, so mfs untars are done
#    in /etc/rc.conf.local, not here
# - even though everything is mounted by the real
#    /etc/rc via /etc/fstab, /etc must be mounted before
#    it is mounted by /etc/rc and parts of /sbin and /bin
#    must be available as well.  thus we do fsck and mount
#    here, not in /etc/rc, and /flash/old recovery here as well
# - to work around /etc/rc trying to fsck everything, the rdrootfs
#    actually has a /fastboot file (which /etc/rc deletes each time)
#
# these are the lengths we go through to have a truly "default" system
#  (such as rc scripts, directories, and so forth) work with a read-only,
#  vnd swappable system
#
# this bootstrap could do quite a bit more to check vnd images for validity
#  and swap to /flash/old as necessary or convenient
#
